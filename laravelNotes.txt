# Laravel Notes

Frameworks are good because

- recipe for clean code
- granular testing and easy to reuse
- changes are easy
- organisation
- prebuilt and pretested
- someone else did the work
- organised
- team collaboration
- modular development

## Do we always need a framework? 

No, because sometimes a few lines of code will do what we need, without having an entire framework in the background

- breaking up code = more steps do do something
- learning curve
